# Null-Coalescing Operator: `??`
The null-coalescing operator evaluates and returns the value of the left-hand expression if it does not evaluate to `invalid`; otherwise it evaluates and returns the value of the right-hand expression. If the left-hand expression is returned, the right-hand expression is not evaluated.
